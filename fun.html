      <h2>Killing Time</h2>
      <h3>
        In my free time, I often find myself hiking, baking, cooking, and listening to as much music as I can get my hands on (see my Spotify for some playlists). I am a competitive runner, specializing in the half-marathon distance (I have also coached some friends!). I also love to read and write, play guitar and bass, and really enjoy singing (badly) in the car.
