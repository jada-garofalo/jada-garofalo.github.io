      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Current Employment</h2>
      <h3>
        Since Jan. 2023, I've worked as an undergraduate coach for the Physics Department. Day-to-day, I act as an assistant to a TA in a recitation section for one of the various courses taught by the department. This usually includes preparation of materials, answering questions during group work, hosting office hours, and other pertinent pedagogical stuff. Most recently, I have worked with Prof. Lisa Manning for PHY215 and Prof. Walter Freeman for PHY211.
      </h3>
      <h2>Past Employment</h2>
      <h3>
        From Jan. 2023 until Dec. 2023, I worked with Prof. Mihovilovic Skanata's lab group as an undergraduate researcher. With this group, we were doing studies on Drosophila larvae, working to better understand the neural basis for their behaviors. During my time with the group, I assisted in the construction of the lab's "behavior boxes", and worked to develop macros in Fiji (ImageJ) to simplify data analysis. I also led the development of a solo project studying the social behavior of the larvae. Before this was put on pause, I did hardware and software work for a PiVR system, wrote procedures, and ran preliminary experiments on the set-up.
      </h3>
      <h2>Past Projects</h2>
      <h3>
        During the Fall semester of 2023, I took PHY307 Computational Physics with Prof. Walter Freeman. Thus far, this has been my primary formal introduction to coding with Python in a Linux environment.

      </h3>
      <h2>Extracurricular Stuff I Do</h2>
      <h3>
        I am a member of the Physics Department's Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee. Specifically, I am an undergraduate representative. With this group, we work to ensure that our department is inclusive for people of all backgrounds, and host discussions about related topics.
      <br />
         In tandem with this, I am the DEI representative for the Society of Physics Students (SPS) E-Board. As a board, we work to organize events for the undergraduate students, host holiday parties, and bring the cohort closer together. I am specifically tasked with also making sure that SPS remains a DEI-friendly space.
      </h3>
      <h2>Silly Stuff I Do</h2>
      <h3>
        In my free time, I often find myself hiking, baking, cooking, or listening to as much music as I can get my hands on (see my Spotify for some playlists). I am a competitive runner, specializing in the half-marathon distance (I also coach some friends!). I also love to read and write (which I practice at <a href="https://www.albumoftheyear.org/user/jaaadaaa/"></a>.)
